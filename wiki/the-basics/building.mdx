The build option can be invoked either from <code>b</code> or <code>build</code> like shown below

```bash
$ apktool b foo.jar.out
# builds foo.jar.out folder into foo.jar.out/dist/foo.jar

$ apktool build foo.jar.out
# builds foo.jar.out folder into foo.jar.out/dist/foo.jar

$ apktool b bar
# builds bar folder into bar/dist/bar.apk

$ apktool b .
# builds current directory into ./dist

$ apktool b bar -o new_bar.apk
# builds bar folder into new_bar.apk

$ apktool b bar.apk
# WRONG: brut.androlib.AndrolibException: brut.directory.PathNotExist: apktool.yml
# Must use folder, not apk/jar file
```

In order to run a rebuilt application, you must resign it.
Android [documentation](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#signing-manually) can help with this.
