## Breaking Changes

### Dropped Support

- **aapt1 support removed** - Apktool now uses aapt2 only.
- **32-bit platforms no longer supported** - Only 64-bit platforms are supported
- **`-api / --api-level` option removed** - API level is now automatically detected
- **Short flags removed for advanced options** - Advanced options now use long-form flags only

#### aapt1 removal
With new features introduced to the `resources.arsc` we noticed aapt1 no longer receiving updates from the official Android Open Source Project. This meant it was time for us to drop it as well so we can evolve Apktool with its integration with the more robust aapt2.

#### 32bit removal
On that same token, AOSP was making it more and more difficult to build native 32 bit binaries out of the project. With Android saying goodbye to 32 bit and computers moving on to 64 bit a long time ago we could reduce our footprint with dropping 32 bit.

#### `-api / --api-level` removal
A large part of our support issues were end users mix and matching api versions to trick baksmali or smali to do a specific task. This always caused more problems than intended so now Apktool properly reads the intended api version and passes that on to baksmali automatically.

#### short flag removal
As we took a look at all CLI options Apktool offered it was a lot. It didn't seem fair that a lot of advance options were hogging single letter short flags that may rarely be executed. With dropping all short flags from advanced options and enforcing a single letter short value we introduced a little shortcut on multiple flags - allowing you to chain them together like `vfo`.

#### resource modes
Historically we had `remove`, `dummy` and `keep` which didn't truly accurately respect their purpose. Now we have:

 * `default` - Adds dummy entries only for resources that cannot be resolved.
 * `greedy` - Adds dummy entries for all missing resources at end of each package.
 * `lazy` - Ignores resources that are missing or cannot be resolved.

This also allowed us to majorly clean up the serialization of dummy resources properly resolving the item/bag type. With unifying this behavior we retired `APKTOOL_MISSING_*` for only `APKTOOL_DUMMY_*` resource names.

#### clean frameworks
With our CLI cleanup we could retire the oddly named `-efd` / `--empty-framework-dir` with a generic `cf` / `--clean-frameworks`. We also added a few flags for this execution.

 * `-a` / `--all` - Include all framework files regardless of tag.
 * `-p` / `--frame-path <dir>` - Set the path for framework files.
 * `-t` / `--frame-tag <tag>` - Suffix the framework files with that tag.

This allows a fine-grained control on cleaning up frameworks specific to directories or tags if you manage a complex set of framework files.

### Configuration Changes

- `packageInfo` renamed to `resourcesInfo` in `apktool.yml` - now represents all transformation options
- Default resolve mode changed to `KEEP` (called `DEFAULT` in v3) instead of `REMOVE`
- Resolve modes renamed to `default`, `greedy`, and `lazy` for improved serialization

### Output Format Changes

- Hex integer values now use compact form (`0x20` instead of `0x00000020`)
- Color values now represent the format from the original APK
- Modern Android standards adopted:
  - `dp` used instead of `dip`
  - `match_parent` used instead of `fill_parent`
