Within an Android application lies a `resources.arsc`, which is a binary file containing resources of the application.
The `.arsc` extension hints at Android Resource Storage Container which is a massive collection of chunks.

If we dumped the first line of the file, we would see the following:

```
00000000: 0200 0c00 f00b 0000 0100 0000 0100 1c00  ................
```

The `.arsc` file uses what is described as a `ResChunk_header` to describe the chunks within the file. This header is
what starts the file off and is as follows:

#### ResChunk_header

| Name        | Size    | Description            |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type        | 2 bytes | The type of the chunk  |
| Header Size | 2 bytes | The size of the header |
| Size        | 4 bytes | The size of the chunk  |

So knowing we have a little endian structure we can parse out this header. We get:

- Type - `0x0002`
- Header Size - `0x000c`
- Size - `0x00000bf0`

So we can leverage the [ResourceTypes.h](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/libs/androidfw/include/androidfw/ResourceTypes.h)
file in order to understand what this chunk is.

```cpp
enum {
    RES_NULL_TYPE                     = 0x0000,
    RES_STRING_POOL_TYPE              = 0x0001,
    RES_TABLE_TYPE                    = 0x0002,
    RES_XML_TYPE                      = 0x0003,
};
```

So we start the file with a `RES_TABLE_TYPE` chunk. This chunk is described as:

#### ResTable_header

| Name          | Size    | Description            |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Header        | 8 bytes | The type of the chunk  |
| Package Count | 4 bytes | The number of packages |

A pretty simple chunk that just helps understand how many `ResTable_package` chunks are within the file. So now that
we understand that each chunk begins with a `ResChunk_header` we can safely read the next chunk to see what it is.

So now let's bring up the line again and mark what we've already read.

```
00000000: [0200 0c00 f00b 0000] 0100 0000 0100 1c00  ................
```

So we can see that the next chunk is a `RES_STRING_POOL_TYPE` (`0x0001`) chunk after reading the `type` of the `ResChunk_header`.
This string pool chunk is described as:

| Name          | Size    | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| String Count  | 4 bytes | Number of strings in the pool                          |
| Style Count   | 4 bytes | Number of style span arrays in pool                    |
| Flags         | 4 bytes | Whether the strings are UTF-8 or UTF-16, sorted or not |
| String Offset | 4 bytes | The offset in bytes from header to the string data     |
| Style Offset  | 4 bytes | The offset in bytes from header to the style data      |

This chunk is a bit more complex than the previous chunk, but we can still parse it out. We learn how many strings and
styles we have and where they start in the file. So Apktool works in this situation by reading those pools of data and
storing them in memory. This allows us to reference them later on when we need to via the indicies.

The String Pool in itself has so many quirks and oddities that we will not be covering them in this document. If you
want a deep dive on how the string pool works. This String Pool (TODO) document can help. For now just assume you can
reference an index in the string pool and get a string back.

The String Pool is important to read first because it contains all the string values of the entire resource table.
However, except not the names of entries or type identifiers are contained within that pool.

So now assuming we properly read the pool and/or skipped it from the information contained in the `ResChunk_header` we
end up at another new chunk. Below is the relevant segment after the String Pool.

```
00000340: 0000 0000] 0002 2001 ac08 0000 7f00 0000  ...... .........
00000350: 6300 6f00 6d00 2e00 6900 6200 6f00 7400  c.o.m...i.b.o.t.
00000360: 7000 6500 6100 6300 6800 6500 7300 2e00  p.e.a.c.h.e.s...
00000370: 6100 7200 7300 6300 7400 6500 7300 7400  a.r.s.c.t.e.s.t.
```

- `]` - end of string pool.

So if we read another `ResChunk_header` we get a new type of chunk. This chunk is a `RES_TABLE_PACKAGE_TYPE` (`0x0200`) chunk
which is described as:

| Name                           | Size     | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package Id                     | 4 bytes  | Package Id                                                                      |
| Package Name                   | Variable | Package Name, null terminated                                                   |
| Type String Offset             | 4 bytes  | Offset to the type symbol table, may be zero if inheriting from another package |
| Last Public Type String Offset | 4 bytes  | Last index in the above table of public types                                   |
| Key Symbol Offset              | 4 bytes  | Offset to the key symbol table, may be zero if inheriting from another package  |
| Last Public Key Symbol Offset  | 4 bytes  | Last index in the above table of key symbols                                    |
| Type Id Offset                 | 4 bytes  | Offset to the specific type ids for split apks                                  |

This chunk suggests from the properties and explanation that this chunk will kick off the child `ResTable_type` and
`ResTable_typeSpec` chunks.
